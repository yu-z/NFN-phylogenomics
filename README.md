# NFN-phylogenomics

This repository contains data and code resource for the study of phylogenomics of N-fixing nodulating plants.
Please see the publications [1]

##Phylogenetic data

XX alignemnts and phylogenetic trees of 200 symbiosis related genes:

##Genomic data

Gff file of NFN-related conserved non-coding elements that mapped to the genome of Medicago trancatula:

##Transcriptomic data

TPM and assemblies of transcriptomes of XX nodulating and XX non-nodulating species:

##Pipeline for detecting convergent evolution.

###### an ‘alignment’ method used to detect convergent signals in nodulating species

###### a‘tree topology inference’ method based on large-scale phylogenetic reconstruction of groups of orthologous genes
